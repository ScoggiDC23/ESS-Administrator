# Endpoint Security Solutions 201 Course Notes
Here's some of the acronyms and terms that we're going to use in this course:
- There's a default administrator account that is created when you install ePO and that's Admin.
-  Whenever I talk about ASCI, that is the agent to server communication interval and that's how often the McAfee Agent communicates with your Agent Handlers. When it communicates, there's an exchange of public keys so that you have what we call the ASSC, or agent-to-server secure communication. So, all of the communication is encrypted, and you don't have to worry about someone capturing the packets and being able to see what is in that communication.
-  Agent is just a short term for the McAfee Agent. We also have what we call an Agent GUID, which is the Global Unique Identifier that the McAfee Agent creates when it's installed on a machine.
-   We have a product called Endpoint Security -- we teach you all about that in the 301 class, but that is one of the security products that takes care of what the Virus Scan Enterprise did and also your Host Intrusion Prevention. We have several names for ePO.
-  We have MVISION EPO which is a software as a service product. Then you also have the ePO On-Prem which more than likely that's going to be the ePO server you will be using.
-  We'll talk all about policies. Those are the settings or rules that you can use to configure an ePO so that your machines know, "oh, this is a configuration I have to have."
-  We'll talk all about repositories. Repositories will have software like the update software or the software to install onto your machines.
-  We have the RSD which is Rogue System Detection. We'll learn all about how you can have the Rogue System Detection on your network so that you'll know that you have some machines on your network that are not managed by your ePO server.
-  We have another type of agent is called a Super Agent and this Super Agent can also be a Super Agent distributor repository.
-  Tags will be labels that you can assign to your machines, and you're going to see all kinds of cool things we can do with Tags.
-  And then last, but not least, Tasks. We have two types of Tasks. There's going to be client Tasks that the client will run according to the schedule you set and also, we have server tasks that will run on the ePO server. 

## ESS
The primary center for the ESS or HBSS, formally known as, customer support is going to be the DISA Global Service Desk.

The architecture of the help desk is 3 tiers. Out in Oklahoma City, that's where you're going to have levels 1 and 2 of the tier support. If we cannot figure it out, get it all fixed, having to do with those two tiers, what they're going to do is they're going to send it to a level 3, and that all has to do with our subject matter expertise. So, all of this HBSS or ESS application support will be provided on behalf of DISA. Level 3 support is going to be provided by the product vendor.

Before you contact them, be sure you fill out the HBSS/ESS Application checklist for the helpdesk team when asking for support.

### ESS Products

#### McAfee Products

ePolicy Orchestrator:
- Main centralized management tool that we will use to manage everything.

ePolicy Orchestrator Optimizer:
- This optimizer runs and it will tell you information having to do with the data that's collected, and it will give you an assessment of your different environment and it'll give you some recommendations.

Data Exchange Layer:
- Gives you what we call bidirectional communication between all of your systems.

Cloud Workload Security:
- Helps you discover, import, manage, and protect the virtual infrastructure from the cloud to ePO. Each Cloud Connector (Amazon/Microsoft/VMWare) will find all of the VMs from different solutions.

Data Loss Prevention Endpoint:
- Monitors or blocks removable storage devices, can create different sets of rules based on needs.

McAfee Application Control features (MAC):
- Whitelisting and inventory aka Solidcore. Application Control gives you the ability to enable it, and at that point it's going to scan and find all applications that exist onto your computer. It'll get all their DLLs, all their executables, everything.

McAfee Endpoint Security:
- VirusScan, Exploit and Firewall capabilities, used for centralized management as well as standalone management.

McAfee Agent:
- The distributed componenet of McAfee ePO. It downloads and enforces policies, and executes client-side tasks such as deployment and updating. Gathers information and events from systems and sends it to the ePO.

Policy Auditor:
- Performs host based auditing. Automates the processes required for internal and external IT audits. It audits systems by comparing settings and software to info that descibes the desired state of the system. You can create custom audits or use standard industry and government audits.

Rogue System Detection:
- Provides real-time detection of rogue systems by using the Rogue System Sensor, installed throughout the network, and will report back to the Agent Handler.

Threat Intelligence Exchange:
- Acts as a reputation broker to enable adaptive threat detectino and response.
- Server stores information about file and certificate reputations, then passes that information to other systems.
- It has Data Exhange Layer brokers that allow bidirectional communication between managed systems on a network.

#### Government Products

Asset Publishing Service:
- The ESS APS publishes assets, operational attribute, software inventory, benchmark audit results, and alert statistics from the McAfee ePO.
- It makes the ESS data visible, assessable, and understandle across the DoD community.

Operational Attribute Module:
- The OAM is the ESS ePO extension that allows associating and tagging assets with key operational metadata.
- Data collected from OAM enables DISA's Continuous Monitoring Risk Scoring (CMRS) system to generate organization-specific reports to quickly assess copmliance, generate risk scores and identify organizations responsible for applying mitigation measures.

Device Attribute Tagging Tool:
- The process of embedding "so what" data onto endpoint devices (who owns it, the location, etc.)
- The DATT is an endpoint application that is deployed to enable users to view and apply attribution tags directly to supported endpoints.

### Requirements for Managing ESS

Common ESS Tasks:
- Check in Product Extension files and client packages
- Configure & fine tune policies
- Deploy the McAfee agent to client computers
- Assign permissions to policies in the Policy Catalog
- Send policy update information to agents
- Set up notifications for ePO events
- Run queries and reports
- Manage the EPO Server and Database

Day to Day Tasks:
1. Respond to events
2. Scavenging inactive agents
3. Rogue systems detected
4. Review inactive agents log
5. React to alerts
6. Backups
7. Check for downloads and general ESS information

### ePO Environment Tiers

ESS Functional Flow SV-1 (NIPR)
- This system view displays the communication paths between the various tiers and servers in the DoD.
- Different data types are collected
