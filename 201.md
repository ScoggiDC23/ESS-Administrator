# Endpoint Security Solutions 201 Course Notes
Here's some of the acronyms and terms that we're going to use in this course:
- There's a default administrator account that is created when you install ePO and that's Admin.
-  Whenever I talk about ASCI, that is the agent to server communication interval and that's how often the McAfee Agent communicates with your Agent Handlers. When it communicates, there's an exchange of public keys so that you have what we call the ASSC, or agent-to-server secure communication. So, all of the communication is encrypted, and you don't have to worry about someone capturing the packets and being able to see what is in that communication.
-  Agent is just a short term for the McAfee Agent. We also have what we call an Agent GUID, which is the Global Unique Identifier that the McAfee Agent creates when it's installed on a machine.
-   We have a product called Endpoint Security -- we teach you all about that in the 301 class, but that is one of the security products that takes care of what the Virus Scan Enterprise did and also your Host Intrusion Prevention. We have several names for ePO.
-  We have MVISION EPO which is a software as a service product. Then you also have the ePO On-Prem which more than likely that's going to be the ePO server you will be using.
-  We'll talk all about policies. Those are the settings or rules that you can use to configure an ePO so that your machines know, "oh, this is a configuration I have to have."
-  We'll talk all about repositories. Repositories will have software like the update software or the software to install onto your machines.
-  We have the RSD which is Rogue System Detection. We'll learn all about how you can have the Rogue System Detection on your network so that you'll know that you have some machines on your network that are not managed by your ePO server.
-  We have another type of agent is called a Super Agent and this Super Agent can also be a Super Agent distributor repository.
-  Tags will be labels that you can assign to your machines, and you're going to see all kinds of cool things we can do with Tags.
-  And then last, but not least, Tasks. We have two types of Tasks. There's going to be client Tasks that the client will run according to the schedule you set and also, we have server tasks that will run on the ePO server.
